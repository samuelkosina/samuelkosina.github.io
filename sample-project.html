The concentration of parts of the population, especially seniors and people with disabilities, in facilities such as nursing homes or institutions is not always a natural solution—particularly in cases where the situation does not require it.

Instead of isolation, we should strive to integrate these groups through community-based care, outpatient services, and community housing.

Institutions often aim to imitate the necessary reality of a home, school, or workplace.
