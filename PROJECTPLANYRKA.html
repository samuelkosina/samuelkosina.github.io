    Public space is often described as empty, neutral, or unfinished. Planyrka is read this way as well. From a distance — especially from a car — it appears open, underused, available. From the ground, it is something else entirely.
</p>

<p>
    Planyrka is not empty. It is full of negotiations. Between human and non-human life. Between movement and staying. Between what is allowed and what is merely tolerated. These negotiations do not happen through design or regulation. They happen through use.
</p>

<p>
    Subcultures are dependent on public space. Not on buildings. Not on institutions. Not on permission. They rely on gaps, edges, and leftover zones — spaces not fully defined by a single function. In these spaces, multiple ways of being can coexist without formal agreement. What appears informal is often highly adaptive.
</p>

<p>
    Parking lots are treated as neutral infrastructure. They are not neutral. They prioritize storage over encounter. Circulation over presence. Waiting over use. Even when empty, they remain occupied — by rules, expectations, and the future arrival of cars.
</p>

<p>
    Cars function as an organizing force. They determine scale, speed, and proximity. They occupy space physically and structure it invisibly. Through priority and repetition, cars exclude mixed communities — human and non-human alike — by limiting how space can be used.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    The intervention does not attempt to correct this condition. It does not offer a solution. The object is a question placed on asphalt. The skateboard bale object interrupts a habit rather than replacing it. 
</p>

<p>
    Skateboarding was chosen not as a sport, but as a connective subculture — moving between informal communities and organized structures. The object does not claim ownership of space. It tests how space responds.
</p>

<p>
    Appropriation is often read as damage. Here, it functions as care. Not destruction. Not protest alone. Not permanence. By slightly misusing what already exists, appropriation makes existing values visible.
</p>

<p>
    Appropriation does not claim space. It exposes the conditions under which space is allowed to exist.
