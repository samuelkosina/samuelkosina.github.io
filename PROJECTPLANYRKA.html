        <p>
    Public space is often described as empty, neutral, or unfinished.
</p>

<p>
    Planyrka is read this way as well.
</p>

<p>
    From a distance — especially from a car — it appears open, underused, available.
</p>

<p>
    From the ground, it is something else entirely.
</p>

<p>
    Planyrka is not empty.
</p>

<p>
    It is full of negotiations.
</p>

<p>
    Between human and non-human life.
</p>

<p>
    Between movement and staying.
</p>

<p>
    Between what is allowed
</p>

<p>
    and what is merely tolerated.
</p>

<p>
    These negotiations do not happen through design or regulation.
</p>

<p>
    They happen through use.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Subcultures are dependent on public space.
</p>

<p>
    Not on buildings.
</p>

<p>
    Not on institutions.
</p>

<p>
    Not on permission.
</p>

<p>
    They rely on gaps, edges, and leftover zones — spaces not fully defined by a single function. In these spaces, multiple ways of being can coexist without formal agreement.
</p>

<p>
    What appears informal is often highly adaptive.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Parking lots are treated as neutral infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
    They are not neutral.
</p>

<p>
    They prioritize storage over encounter.
</p>

<p>
    Circulation over presence.
</p>

<p>
    Waiting over use.
</p>

<p>
    Even when empty, they remain occupied — by rules, expectations, and the future arrival of cars.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Cars function as an organizing force.
</p>

<p>
    They determine scale, speed, and proximity.
</p>

<p>
    They occupy space physically
</p>

<p>
    and structure it invisibly.
</p>

<p>
    Through priority and repetition, cars exclude mixed communities — human and non-human alike — by limiting how space can be used.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    The intervention does not attempt to correct this condition.
</p>

<p>
    It does not offer a solution.
</p>

<p>
    The object is a question placed on asphalt.
</p>

<p>
    The skateboard bale object interrupts a habit rather than replacing it. Skateboarding was chosen not as a sport, but as a connective subculture — moving between informal communities and organized structures.
</p>

<p>
    The object does not claim ownership of space.
</p>

<p>
    It tests how space responds.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Appropriation is often read as damage.
</p>

<p>
    Here, it functions as care.
</p>

<p>
    Not destruction.
</p>

<p>
    Not protest alone.
</p>

<p>
    Not permanence.
</p>

<p>
    By slightly misusing what already exists, appropriation makes existing values visible.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    <b>Appropriation does not claim space.</b>
</p>

<p>
    <b>It exposes the conditions under which space is allowed to exist.</b>
</p>
        <p>

             <p>This object is a skatable element constructed from reused metal air ducts. By reworking and reconnecting 
their original joints, the industrial components are transformed into a refined, skatable edge. 
The object functions as a physical proposal that complements the theoretical and video work, 
translating its themes into a physical form.</p>
